# Python Code Style Guide

## Principles

1. [PEP-8 Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
1. [Explicit is better than implicit](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/)
1. [Do not repeat yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)
1. [Keep things simple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)
1. [Keep things intuitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment)

## Code

1. [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html)
1. Keep method cyclomatic complexity as low as possible: avoid `if` statetments when possible. Never use nested `if`.
1. The lesser indent your code have, the better. Avoid finding yourself farer than 4th indent.
1. Use `pyflakes`, `isort`, `black` to format your code
